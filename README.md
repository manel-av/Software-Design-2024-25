# Software Design

## Course Description

This course taught us how to design software correctly, using UML diagrams and design patterns to structure our applications efficiently. The main focus was on object-oriented programming and how to create scalable and maintainable systems.

## Practical Work

The practical project involved designing an Access Control System (ACS), which simulated how electronic door locks are managed in a building. We started by analyzing the system requirements and then designed UML diagrams (class diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.) to model the system. After that, we implemented a prototype using Java and REST APIs, ensuring that users could authenticate and interact with the system correctly.
